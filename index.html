      <h4>Congratulations, you’re a street-walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm and you’re not going to let a faint whiff of urine or a claustrophobic subway car keep you from taking Gotham by storm. Now you just have to save up $300 million dollars for a real estate broker and you’ll be all set! The world is your OYSTER! </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="congratulations more-b">
      <h4>New York is NOT the place for you and you are NOT a real New Yorker! In NYC there’s no place to put your trash, so everyone just heaps it up IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDEWALK. At night, the trash monsters emerge zombie-like from the piles looking for innocent victims to kill for their own enjoyment. Also, Shake Shack lines are long. I suggest you run while you still can! </h4>
